        <p>A sexy hybrid cow-woman— her hindquarters are on display as she’s mooing in delight. She offers you some milk from her human breasts, or, rather, you pump it out of her yourself. You can get to know her better in a private booth if you wish.

        <br>   
        <br>

        Whether she is squirming in pleasure or struggling against her constraints is unclear. But the cow-woman does not seem to resist her confinement and domination.</p>
